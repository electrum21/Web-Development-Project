This project was part of a Web Development module, with the following requirements:
<br>•	At least 3 web pages
<br>•	At least 1 table
<br>•	At least 1 form (with submit button, a response page to show the data entered in the form)
<br>•	Use hyperlinks
<br>•	Use multimedia elements (e.g. pictures, video or audio)
<br>•	Use Cascading Style Sheets
<br>•	Use JavaScript
<br>•	Has a navigation menu to navigate across all pages

Marks were awarded based on the correctness of HTML, CSS and JS usage, resourcefulness, completeness and quality of work, and website usability.

Since there were no strict requirements on the theme of the website, I developed and designed the website to feature my favourite K-POP Group, (G)I-DLE.
